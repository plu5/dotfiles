# KEYS CONFIG SYNTAX
#        .config/feh/keys defines key bindings.  It has entries of the form "action [key1 [key2 [key3]]]".

#        Each key is an X11 keysym name as shown by xev(1), like "Delete".  It may optionally  start  with  modifiers
#        for  things like Control, in which case key looks like mod-keysym (for example "C-Delete" for Ctrl+Delete or
#        "C-1-Delete" for Ctrl+Alt+Delete)

#        Available modifiers are C for Control, S for Shift and 1, 4 for Mod1 and Mod4.  To match an uppercase letter
#        like "S" instead of "s", the Shift modifier is not required.

#        Specifying an action without any keys unbinds it (i.e. the default bindings are removed).
# ...skipping...

# KEYS
#        The  following  actions  and  default  key bindings can be used in an image window.  (The strings in [square
#        brackets] are the config action names).  If feh is running inside a terminal and its standard input  is  not
#        used for images or filelists, key input from the terminal is also accepted.  However, terminal input support
#        is  currently  limited  to  most alphanumeric characters (0-9 a-z A-Z and some more), arrow keys, return and
#        backspace.  The Alt (Mod1) modifier is also supported.

#        a [toggle_actions]
#                Toggle actions display (see --draw-actions)

#        A [toggle_aliasing]
#                Enable/Disable anti-aliasing

#        c [toggle_caption]
#                Caption entry mode.  If --caption-path has been specified, then this enables caption  editing.   The
#                caption  at  the bottom of the screen will turn yellow and can be edited.  Hit return to confirm and
#                save the caption, or escape to cancel editing.  Note that you can insert an actual newline into  the
#                caption using ⟨Ctrl+return⟩.

#        d [toggle_filenames]
#                Toggle filename display (see --draw-filename)

#        e [toggle_exif]
#                (optional feature, available in this build) Toggle EXIF tag display

#        f [toggle_fullscreen]
#                Toggle fullscreen

#        g [toggle_fixed_geometry]
#                Enable/Disable automatic window resize when changing images.

#        h [toggle_pause]
#                Pause/Continue  the  slideshow.  When it is paused, it will not automatically change slides based on
#                --slideshow-delay.

#        i [toggle_info]
#                Toggle info display (see --info)

#        k [toggle_keep_vp]
#                Toggle zoom and viewport keeping.  When enabled, feh will keep zoom and X, Y offset  when  switching
#                images.

#        L [save_filelist]
#                Save  the  current  filelist  as  "feh_PID_ID_filelist".   It is saved in the directory specified by
#                --output-dir, if set, and in the current working directory otherwise.

#        m [toggle_menu]
#                Show menu.  Use the arrow keys and return to select items, and ⟨escape⟩ to close the menu.

#        n, ⟨space⟩, ⟨Right⟩ [next_img]
#                Show next image.  Selects the next image in thumbnail mode.

#        o [toggle_pointer]
#                Toggle pointer visibility

#        p, ⟨BackSpace⟩, ⟨Left⟩ [prev_img]
#                Show previous image.  Selects the previous image in thumbnail mode.

#        q, ⟨Escape⟩ [quit]
#                Quit feh

#        r [reload_image]
#                Reload current image.  Useful for webcams

#        s [save_image]
#                Save the current image as  "feh_PID_ID_FILENAME".   It  is  saved  in  the  directory  specified  by
#                --output-dir, if set, and in the current working directory otherwise.

#        w [size_to_image]
#                Change  window  size  to fit current image size (plus/minus zoom, if set).  In scale-down and fixed-
#                geometry mode, this also updates the window size limits.

#        x [close]
#                Close current window

#        z [jump_random]
#                Jump to a random position in the current filelist

#        Z [toggle_auto_zoom]
#                Toggle auto-zoom.

#        [, ] [prev_dir, next_dir]
#                Jump to the first image of the previous or next sequence of images sharing a directory name  in  the
#                current filelist.  Use --sort dirname if you would like to ensure that all images in a directory are
#                grouped together.

#        <, > [orient_3, orient_1]
#                rotate the image 90 degrees (counter)clockwise.

#                When  --edit is used, this also rotates the image in the underlying file.  Rotation is lossless, but
#                may create artifacts in some image corners when used with JPEG images.  Rotating in the reverse  di‐
#                rection  will  make them go away.  See jpegtran(1) for more about lossless JPEG rotation.  Note: feh
#                assumes that this feature is used to normalize image orientation.  For JPEG images, it will uncondi‐
#                tionally set the EXIF orientation  tag  to  1  ("0,0  is  top  left")  after  every  rotation.   See
#                jpegexiforient(1) for details on how to change this flag.

#        _ [flip]
#                Vertically  flip  image.  When --edit is used, this also flips the image in the underlying file (see
#                above).

#        | [mirror]
#                Horizontally flip image.  When --edit is used, this also flips the image in the underlying file (see
#                above).

#        0 .. 9 [action_0 .. action_9]
#                Execute the corresponding action (0 = --action, 1 = --action1 etc.)

#        ⟨Return⟩ [action_0]
#                Run the command defined by --action

#        ⟨Home⟩ [jump_first]
#                Show first image

#        ⟨End⟩ [jump_last]
#                Show last image

#        ⟨page up⟩ [jump_fwd]
#                Go forward ~5% of the filelist

#        ⟨page down⟩ [jump_back]
#                Go backward ~5% of the filelist

#        + [reload_plus]
#                Increase reload delay by 1 second

#        - [reload_minus]
#                Decrease reload delay by 1 second

#        ⟨Delete⟩ [remove]
#                Remove current file from filelist

#        ⟨Ctrl+Delete⟩ [delete]
#                Remove current file from filelist and delete it

#        ⟨keypad Left⟩, ⟨Ctrl+Left⟩ [scroll_left]
#                Scroll to the left

#        ⟨keypad Right⟩, ⟨Ctrl+Right⟩ [scroll_right]
#                Scroll to the right

#        ⟨keypad up⟩, ⟨Ctrl+Up⟩ [scroll_up]
#                Scroll up

#        ⟨keypad Down⟩, ⟨Ctrl+Down⟩ [scroll_down]
#                Scroll down.  Note that the scroll keys work without anti-aliasing for performance reasons; hit  the
#                render key after scrolling to anti-alias the image.

#        ⟨Alt+Left [scroll_left_page]⟩
#                Scroll to the left by one page

#        *, ⟨keypad *⟩ [zoom_default]
#                Zoom to 100%

#        /, ⟨keypad /⟩ [zoom_fit]
#                Zoom to fit the window size

#        ! [zoom_fill]
#                Zoom to fill the window size like --bg-fill

#    MENU KEYS
#        The following keys bindings are used for the feh menu:

#        ⟨Escape⟩ [menu_close]
#                Close the menu

#        ⟨Up⟩ [menu_up]
#                Highlight previous menu item

#                Select highlighted menu item

# BUTTONS CONFIG SYNTAX
#        .config/feh/buttons.  This works like the keys config file: the entries are of the form "action [binding]".

#        Each  binding  is a button number.  It may optionally start with modifiers for things like Control, in which
#        case binding looks like mod-button (for example C-1 for Ctrl + Left button).

#        Note: Do not use the same button for multiple actions.  feh does not  check  for  conflicting  bindings,  so
#        their  behaviour is undefined.  Either unbind the unwanted action, or bind it to another unused button.  The
#        order in which you bind / unbind does not matter, though.

#        For the available modifiers, see “KEYS CONFIGURATION SYNTAX”.

#    BUTTONS
#        In an image window, the following buttons may be used (The strings  in  [square  brackets]  are  the  config
#        action names).  Additionally, all actions specified in the “KEYS” section can also be bound to a button.

#        unbound [reload]
#                Reload current image

#        0 ⟨cursor movement while not panning, zooming, or similar⟩
#                Does not have a default binding.  By binding it to quit, you can turn feh into a simple screensaver.

#        1 ⟨left mouse button⟩ [pan]
#                pan the current image

#        2 ⟨middle mouse button⟩ [zoom]
#                Zoom the current image

#        3 ⟨right mouse button⟩ [toggle_menu]
#                Toggle menu


#        4 ⟨mousewheel down⟩ [prev_img]
#                Show previous image

#        5 ⟨mousewheel up⟩ [next_img]
#                Show next image

#        Ctrl+1 [blur]
#                Blur current image

#        Ctrl+2 [rotate]
#                Rotate current image

#        unbound [zoom_in]
#                Zoom in


#        unbound [zoom_in]
#                Zoom in

#        unbound [zoom_out]
#                Zoom out

# MOUSE ACTIONS
#        Default  Bindings:  When  viewing  an  image,  mouse button 1 pans the image (moves it around) or, when only
#        clicked, moves to the next image (slideshow mode only).  Quick drags with less than 2px of movement per axis
#        will be treated as clicks to aid graphics tablet users.  Mouse button 2 zooms (click and drag left->right to
#        zoom in, right->left to zoom out, click once to restore zoom to 100%) and mouse button 3 opens the menu.

#        Ctrl+Button 1 blurs or sharpens the image (drag left to blur, right to sharpen); Ctrl+Button 2  rotates  the
#        image around the center point.

#        A note about pan and zoom modes: In pan mode, if you reach a window border but haven't yet panned to the end
#        of the image, feh will warp your cursor to the opposite border so you can continue panning.

#        When  clicking  the  zoom  button  and  immediately releasing it, the image will be back at 100% zoom.  When
#        clicking it and moving the mouse while holding the button down, the zoom will be continued at  the  previous
#        zoom  level.   The zoom will always happen so that the pixel on which you entered the zoom mode remains sta‐
#        tionary.  So, to enlarge a specific part of an image, click the zoom button on that part.

# SIGNALS
#        In slideshow and multiwindow mode, feh handles the following signals:

#        SIGUSR1
#                Slideshow mode: switch to next image; reload current image if the slideshow  consists  of  a  single
#                file.  Multiwindow mode: reload all images.

#        SIGUSR2
#                Slideshow mode: switch to previous image; reload current image if the slideshow consists of a single
#                file.  Multiwindow mode: reload all images.

# USAGE EXAMPLES
#        Here are some examples of useful option combinations.  See also: ⟨https://feh.finalrewind.org/examples/⟩

#        feh ~/Pictures
#                Show all images in ~/Pictures

#        feh -r ~/Pictures
#                Recursively show all images found in ~/Pictures and subdirectories

#        feh -rSfilename --version-sort ~/Pictures
#                Same  as  above,  but  sort naturally.  By default, feh will show files in the string order of their
#                names, meaning e.g.  "foo 10.jpg" will come before "foo 2.jpg".  In this case, they are instead  or‐
#                dered as a human would expect.

#        feh -t -Sfilename -E 128 -y 128 -W 1024 ~/Pictures
#                Show 128x128 pixel thumbnails, limit window width to 1024 pixels.

#        feh  -t  -Sfilename  -E  128  -y  128  -W  1024  -P -C /usr/share/fonts/truetype/ttf-dejavu/ -e DejaVuSans/8
#                ~/Pictures
#                Same as above, but enable thumbnail caching and use a smaller font.

#        feh -irFarial/14 -O index.jpg ~/Pictures
#                Make an index print of ~/Pictures and all directories below it, using 14 point Arial  to  write  the
#                image info under each thumbnail.  Save the image as index.jpg and don't display it, just exit.  Note
#                that this even works without a running X server

#        feh --unloadable -r ~/Pictures
#                Print all unloadable images in ~/Pictures, recursively

#        feh -f by_width -S width --reverse --list .
#                Write a list of all images in the directory to by_width, sorted by width (widest images first)

#        feh -w ~/Pictures/holidays
#                Open each image in ~/Pictures/holidays in its own window

#        feh -FD5 -Sname ~/Pictures/presentation
#        zoom in, right->left to zoom out, click once to restore zoom to 100%) and mouse button 3 opens the menu.

#        Ctrl+Button 1 blurs or sharpens the image (drag left to blur, right to sharpen); Ctrl+Button 2  rotates  the
#        image around the center point.

#        A note about pan and zoom modes: In pan mode, if you reach a window border but haven't yet panned to the end
#        of the image, feh will warp your cursor to the opposite border so you can continue panning.

#        When  clicking  the  zoom  button  and  immediately releasing it, the image will be back at 100% zoom.  When
#        clicking it and moving the mouse while holding the button down, the zoom will be continued at  the  previous
#        zoom  level.   The zoom will always happen so that the pixel on which you entered the zoom mode remains sta‐
#        tionary.  So, to enlarge a specific part of an image, click the zoom button on that part.
