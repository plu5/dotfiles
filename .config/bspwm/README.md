# bspwm config
## external rules
- open windows in the right workspace automatically
- applications launched with profi launched in the desktop they were launched from rather than current desktop. avoids me having to wait, i can go do something else on another workspace then come back.

i use 10 workspaces : 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0

i use workspace 1 for emacs, 2-4 for firefox windows, 0 (i.e. last) for chromium

the rest is arbitrary and to be honest it bothers me because for example if i am working on workspace 5 it's painful moving between 1 and 5 because 5 is hard to reach. and 2-4 are taken up. so there should be maybe a better way or better hotkeys but i don't know what.
