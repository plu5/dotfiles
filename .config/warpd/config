# because by default it's n - / and minus i click by accident and it exits me, so putting it out of the way. but alas it does not work and it still presses mouse 2 and exits me when i press - :-/

# ^ these hotkeys work but it doesn't disable the original ones. i guess i have to bind minus to do something else to prevent it from being used for oneshot.

# there's no key to centre horizontally. "middle" only centres vertically. but a trick is to activate grid mode with g that puts the cursor at the centre of the screen then quit it with q. or:
grid_exit: g
# that works. with this it lets you press g two times to go to the centre (it enters and exits grid mode) also useful in that it flashes on the screen a bit which would help if i lose cursor position which is usually why i want to centre it.
